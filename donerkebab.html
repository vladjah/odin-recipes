    <h1>Doner Kebab</h1>
    <p>
        Doner kebab is a type of kebab, made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie.
        Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. 
        The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the meat as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire,
        and dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, Canadian donair, and Mexican al pastor are derived from this.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The modern sandwich variant of döner kebab originated and was popularized in 1970s West Berlin by Turkish immigrants.
    This was recognized by the Berlin-based Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in Europe, in 2011. Nowadays there are more döner kebab stores 
    in Berlin than in Istanbul</p>

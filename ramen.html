        <h1>Ramen</h1>     
        <p>is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a broth;
        common flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including sliced pork, 
        nori (dried seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes.
        Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido.

        Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodle soups.It is first recorded to have appeared in Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century.
        Although the ramen takes its name from lāmiàn, it does not actually evolve from the northern Chinese dish of lamian.
